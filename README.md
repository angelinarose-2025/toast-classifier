## 💡 Project Description  
A web app that analyzes your toast and tells you whether it's uncooked, perfectly crisp, or burnt to a tragic crisp — all using computer vision and vibes.

---

## ❌ The Problem (That Doesn't Exist)  
People are guessing their toast doneness with their eyes and instincts. That’s risky, imprecise, and chaotic. What if you toast too much and ruin breakfast?

---

## ✅ The Solution (Nobody Asked For)  
We use OpenCV and Streamlit to take an image of your toast, analyze the brightness of the center region, and classify it from “Uncooked” to “Burnt to a Crisp” — complete with fun emojis and a glowing box of judgment.

This workflow processes the center region of the uploaded toast image, computes masked brightness, and classifies it into one of five burn levels using OpenCV and Streamlit.
